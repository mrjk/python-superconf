# 4. Class Instantiation Policy

Date: 2025-01-23

## Status

Draft

## Context

Optimization of object lifecycle management requires strict instantiation policies to minimize memory overhead and maintain predictable object creation patterns.

## Decision

### Class Instantiation Specifications

1. `Configuration` Class:
    * Primary instantiation scope: Application level
    * Lifecycle: Usually single instance per configuration context
    * Responsibility: Configuration state management

2. `Field` Class:
    * Instantiation constraints:
        * Class definition context only (user)
        * Child object declarations (internal only)
    * Lifecycle: Bound to parent Configuration instance
    * Responsibility: Field configuration

3. `Loader` Class:
    * Primary instantiation context: Class definitions
    * Supported patterns:
        * Static class-defined loaders
        * Instance loaders for edge case handling
    * Lifecycle: Determined by usage context
    * Responsibility: Data loaders

4. `Cast` Class:
    * Primary instantiation scope: Application level
    * Purpose: Edge case type conversion handling
    * Lifecycle: On-demand instantiation
    * Responsibility: Type casting
    
## Consequences

* Reduced memory footprint through controlled instantiation
* Clear object ownership hierarchies
* Predictable object lifecycle management
* Flexibility for edge case handling while maintaining core patterns

Note: This specification requires further refinement for complete implementation guidelines.
