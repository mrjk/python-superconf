# 1. Record architecture decisions

Date: 2025-01-23

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Implementation of a systematic approach for documenting architectural decisions is required for maintaining technical documentation and design rationale throughout the project lifecycle.

## Decision

Implementation of Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) following the Nygard specification ([reference implementation](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions)) will be utilized as the standard documentation format.

## Consequences

The implementation follows the specifications outlined in Nygard's documentation. For automated ADR management, the project can integrate with Nat Pryce's [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools) for version control and standardization of ADR workflows.
