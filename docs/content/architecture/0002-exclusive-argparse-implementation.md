# 2. Exclusive argparse Implementation

Date: 2025-01-23

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Integration of multiple argument parsing libraries (e.g., Click, Typer, Cliff) would significantly increase implementation complexity and maintenance overhead. Each parser implementation requires specific adaptation layers and ongoing compatibility maintenance.

## Decision

Implementation scope is restricted to Python's native `argparse` module exclusively. The API architecture will be designed with clear abstraction boundaries to facilitate third-party parser implementations through extension points.

## Consequences

* Third-party parser implementations must be maintained externally
* API design requires well-defined interfaces for parser integration
* Reduced core codebase complexity and maintenance burden
* Clear separation of concerns between core functionality and parser implementations
