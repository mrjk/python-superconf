# 2. Project motivation

Date: 2025-01-23

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Python applications often require handling configuration from multiple sources, with proper type validation and flexibility. Existing solutions have limitations:

- Lack of strong type safety
- Limited support for nested configurations
- Complex APIs
- Insufficient validation mechanisms
- Limited flexibility in configuration sources

The project aims to address these limitations while building upon proven concepts from projects like Cafram and ClassyConf.

## Decision

We decided to create SuperConf as a new configuration management library with the following key principles:

1. Strong type safety and validation at the core
2. Support for multiple configuration sources (environment variables, files, dictionaries)
3. Clean and intuitive API inspired by successful patterns
4. Comprehensive field types with extensibility
5. First-class support for nested configurations
6. Modern Python features (3.9+) for better developer experience

## Consequences

### Benefits

- Improved reliability through type-safe configuration
- Reduced configuration-related bugs through validation
- Better developer experience with clear, intuitive API
- Flexibility in configuration sources and formats
- Easy extension through custom field types
- Strong foundation for complex configuration needs

### Challenges

- Maintaining backward compatibility with Python 3.9+
- Need for comprehensive documentation
- Ongoing maintenance of multiple configuration sources
- Potential performance considerations with validation
- Need to balance flexibility with simplicity
